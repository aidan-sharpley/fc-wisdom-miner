# Intelligent Forum Analysis & Search Engine

This is a high-performance forum analysis application that uses local LLMs to provide accurate, data-driven insights and powerful semantic search for any forum thread.

Designed to run efficiently on consumer hardware (8GB RAM), this Flask-based tool scrapes entire forum threads, processes and enriches the content, and builds a sophisticated local search engine. It features a unique dual-engine query system that can distinguish between:

- **Analytical questions** (e.g., "Who is the most active user?") and
- **Semantic questions** (e.g., "What are the best heating techniques?").

The system provides 100% accurate, data-driven answers for analytical queries and nuanced, context-aware responses for semantic queries.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Dual-Engine Query System**: Accurately answers both analytical (data-driven) and semantic (LLM-based) questions. No more wrong answers for statistical queries.
- ðŸ”— **Clickable Post Links**: Provides direct links to the specific source posts for all analytical results, ensuring full traceability.
- ðŸ§  **Local LLM Powered**: Uses Ollama for all text generation and embedding tasks.
