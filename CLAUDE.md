# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Commands

This is a professional Python Flask application that requires Ollama running locally. The main application is in `app.py`.

### Running the Application
```bash
uv run python app.py
```
The app will start on port 8080 at http://localhost:8080

### Prerequisites
- **Ollama must be running locally** with the required models:
  - `deepseek-r1:1.5b` (for text generation)
  - `nomic-embed-text:v1.5` (for embeddings)
- Python 3.9+ with required dependencies managed by `uv`

### Dependencies
Install using uv (preferred) or pip:
```bash
uv pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4 hnswlib numpy tqdm
```

Core dependencies:
- Flask (web framework)
- requests (HTTP client)
- beautifulsoup4 (HTML parsing)
- hnswlib (vector indexing)
- numpy (numerical operations)
- tqdm (progress bars)

### Environment Variables
- `BASE_TMP_DIR`: Directory for data storage (default: "tmp")
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: Ollama base URL (default: "http://localhost:11434")
- `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL`: Model for text generation (default: "deepseek-r1:1.5b")
- `OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL`: Model for embeddings (default: "nomic-embed-text:v1.5")

## Architecture Overview - Modular v2.0

This is a **completely redesigned modular forum analysis application** with separate components for scraping, processing, embedding, search, and analytics. The architecture prioritizes performance, accuracy, and maintainability.

### Core Modular Components

#### 1. **Enhanced Forum Scraper** (`scraping/forum_scraper.py`)

- **Enhanced Vote Extraction**: Captures community engagement from multiple forum types
- **Advanced Caching**: Content-based cache with intelligent cleanup
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent embedding generation and search operations

### üîÑ **Reprocess Functionality** - **MAJOR UPDATE**
- **HTML-Based Reprocessing**: Re-parses original HTML files with new optimizations
- **No Re-downloading**: Respects rate limits, only downloads when thread deleted/recreated
- **Optimization Updates**: Apply new features to existing threads without internet requests
- **Backward Compatible**: Fallback support for threads without saved HTML

### üìä **Advanced Analytics**
- **Thread Statistics**: Complete participant analysis, posting patterns
- **Content Insights**: Primary keywords, discussion themes, engagement metrics  
- **Temporal Analysis**: Activity over time, peak periods, thread evolution
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed timing and operation statistics

- **Data Consistency**: Atomic operations and validation throughout pipeline
- **Professional Logging**: Structured logs with appropriate detail levels

## Critical Improvements Made

### 1. **Fixed Analytical Query Accuracy** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: "Who is most active user?" returned wrong answers based on semantic search
**Solution**: Added `ForumDataAnalyzer` that counts ALL posts by author across entire thread
**Result**: 100% accurate data-driven answers for statistical queries

### 2. **Complete Forum Coverage** ‚úÖ  
**Problem**: Only scraped 50 pages, missing majority of large threads
**Solution**: Enhanced scraper with up to 1000 pages, better pagination detection
**Result**: Captures complete forum discussions with all participants

### 3. **HTML-Based Reprocessing** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Reprocessing meant regenerating embeddings from same processed data
**Solution**: Save raw HTML during scraping, reprocess from original source with new optimizations
**Result**: True reprocessing that applies new features to existing threads

### 4. **Enhanced Community Engagement** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Ignored upvotes, reactions, community signals in ranking
**Solution**: Extract and factor votes/reactions into multi-factor ranking system
**Result**: Popular, well-received posts surface higher in results

### 5. **Domain-Specific Optimization** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Generic text processing missed vape/device terminology
**Solution**: Domain-specific preprocessing and HyDE generation
**Result**: Better understanding of technical discussions and terminology

## Usage Patterns

### For New Threads
```
1. Enter forum thread URL
2. System downloads all pages and saves HTML
3. Processes posts with vote extraction and optimization
4. Generates embeddings with domain-specific preprocessing  
5. Creates analytics and search indexes
6. Ready for queries
```

### For Existing Threads  
```
1. Select existing thread (no URL input)
2. Choose "reprocess" to apply new optimizations
3. System re-parses saved HTML files (no re-download)
4. Rebuilds with latest processing, ranking, and analytics
5. Updated thread with new features
```

### Query Types Handled
- **Analytical**: "Who posted most?", "How many posts?", "When was first post?"
- **Semantic**: "What are the best heating techniques?", "How do I fix vapor quality?"
- **Positional**: "What did the second post say?", "First post on page 3?"  
- **Temporal**: "What changed over time?", "Recent developments?"
- **Participant**: "What did UserX contribute?", "Most active contributors?"

## Development Guidelines

- **Use `uv run python`** for all Python execution (user prefers uv over pip)
- **Never create files unless absolutely necessary** for the task
- **Always prefer editing existing files** to creating new ones
- **Focus on query accuracy while maintaining performance**
- **Test analytical queries** to ensure they use data analysis, not semantic search
- **Verify HTML preservation** for reprocessing functionality
- **Check vote extraction** is working for community engagement features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Thread not found" on reprocess**: HTML files missing, will fallback to posts.json method
2. **Analytical queries using semantic search**: Check `ForumDataAnalyzer.can_handle_query()` patterns
3. **Missing vote data**: Verify forum platform CSS selectors in `config/settings.py`
4. **Slow performance**: Check embedding cache hit rate and HNSW index parameters

### Performance Monitoring
- All major operations include timing statistics
- Embedding cache hit/miss ratios tracked
- Search result ranking scores available
- Thread processing metrics logged

The application now provides **production-ready forum analysis** with comprehensive accuracy, performance optimization, and professional architecture suitable for analyzing large-scale forum discussions.
