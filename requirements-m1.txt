# M1 MacBook Air optimized requirements
# Tested working configuration for 8GB M1 systems

# Core ML/Data processing - M1 compatible versions
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0  # numpy 2.x has M1 compatibility issues with Python 3.13
requests>=2.28.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0
tqdm>=4.64.0

# Vector search - HNSW for efficient nearest neighbor
hnswlib>=0.7.0

# Web framework
Flask>=2.2.0

# System monitoring (optional but recommended)
psutil>=5.9.0

# Note: This configuration avoids numpy 2.x which can hang during import
# on M1 Macs with Python 3.13. Using numpy 1.26.4 provides stability.
